# Git-Up
 A little command runner program that runs CMD scripts (made for quick use of comiting to github and using git commands) 

 This program is to help assist in creating quick scripts for you to runner
 
 
 I personally use it to commit to branches so I dont push to main
 Setup your own quick commands using files with commands
 
 This can run straight CMD scripts aswell for automation
